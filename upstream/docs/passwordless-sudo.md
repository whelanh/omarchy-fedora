# Temporary passwordless sudo

`omarchy-sudo-passwordless` publishes a bounded grant for the numeric UID authenticated by sudo. Its user interface runs without a reusable sudo timestamp; fixed installed internal actions run as root and serialize on `/run/lock/omarchy-sudo-passwordless.lock`.

## Grant lifecycle

The sudoers rule is the only grant record: it contains the resolved account name and a UTC `NOTAFTER` deadline enforced by sudo itself, including after suspend. Publication validates a dot-prefixed temporary file with `visudo`, arms a calendar cleanup timer, then atomically renames the complete rule into place. There is no separate per-user state file to publish, parse, or reconcile. Failure after renewal starts removes the old grant; failed revocation remains an error and leaves the cleanup timer armed.

An internal status result is `0` for an active, validated grant and `3` for confirmed inactive access. All other results are errors, including failed authentication and failed revocation. The user interface only offers a new grant after result `3`. It must not turn an inspection failure into a claim that no grant exists.

Calendar timers clean up expired files; their liveness does not define authorization. Callbacks read the current rule and remove it only when expired. Earlier callbacks cannot shorten a renewed grant, so no timer identity needs to be persisted. Old UID-only and token-bearing callbacks remain accepted. Pending callbacks after renewal or manual disable are harmless and expire within the maximum 24-hour grant window. Boot-time tmpfiles cleanup removes the reserved generated filename namespace before users log in; routine non-boot tmpfiles maintenance leaves live grants alone.

Legacy cleanup uses a root-owned machine marker under `/var/lib/omarchy/migrations/`, written only after successful cleanup under the grant lock. Later accounts can finish their migration queues without sudo and without revoking grants created after the repair. Old grant state files are no longer consulted. A legacy grant is recognized by its exact filename and rule relationship, since the old command wrote the caller's unvalidated name into both, so accounts outside the current name policy are still cleaned up. The generated filename prefix is reserved: boot cleanup and the package hook already remove everything under it, and the old writer could emit a rule whose body differs from its filename, so the migration moves any other file found there into a fresh root-only directory under `/var/lib/omarchy/sudoers-quarantine/`, as `policy` with the original name stored beside it, rather than leaving it live or deleting its content.

## Package ownership

The packaging companion must put the publication/expiry command, `omarchy-security-functions`, `omarchy-nopasswd-sudo.conf`, and the pre-transaction revocation hook in the settings package together. Removing the desktop runtime alone must leave a working expiry command behind. Stable and development package pairs must transfer ownership in one transaction without duplicate files.

Before settings removal or upgrade, the installed ALPM `PreTransaction` hook invokes the fixed `__package-removing` action, acquires the same grant lock, sets `/run/omarchy-sudo-passwordless-package-removing` and revokes existing policy. The marker prevents a waiting publisher from creating a new grant while package files change. A successful installation clears the marker only after boot cleanup exists. The hook uses `AbortOnFail` because a scriptlet failure alone does not abort pacman. The scriptlets repeat cleanup as a fallback for upgrades from older packages that have no installed hook. New grants require both the boot rule and hook before publication. Failed or interrupted transactions leave the marker set; retry the package transaction successfully before requesting another grant.

The runtime marker need not survive reboot: pre-removal revokes the old grants before package files disappear, and a new invocation independently verifies boot cleanup. Both root operations use fixed machine paths. The marker is not a user-controlled mode switch.

## Validation

The two passwordless-sudo test suites share a private filesystem and command fixture. They cover caller validation, the public prompt boundary, atomic publication, renewal failures, expiry, old callbacks, machine migration, and the source/package lock. Supply `OMARCHY_PKGS_PATH` as either a repository root or its `pkgbuilds` directory. An optional `OMARCHY_TEST_SUDOERS` path to sudo's upstream `testsudoers` executable evaluates the generated policy before and after its deadline without root or changing host policy.

These local tests do not establish release readiness. The simplified candidate needs fresh installed-package, suspend/resume, boot-cleanup, and package-removal validation in a disposable VM. The shared security library and its interface are unchanged for downstream PRs.
