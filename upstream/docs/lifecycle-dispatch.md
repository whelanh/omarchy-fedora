# Lifecycle dispatch

Omarchy owns the boot lifecycle flows: the owner wizard, account creation, LUKS discovery, retry journals, snapshots, the migration runner and the update flow. Some platforms boot through a chain those flows can't drive generically. Apple Silicon Macs boot m1n1 → U-Boot → Limine, keep the install key on an ext4 boot partition and name it on the kernel command line. For those platforms, the flows call a small fixed set of operations through `bin/omarchy-lifecycle-dispatch`, and a platform boot package implements them as root-owned entrypoints. System and user setup, and the installers of apps a platform needs to adjust, call a few more, which a platform's runtime package implements, so its own setup runs from Omarchy's without an inline platform branch. Every other platform keeps the generic path, and each dispatch call is a no-op there.

## The command

```
omarchy-lifecycle-dispatch <operation> [arguments...]
omarchy-lifecycle-dispatch --resolve <operation>
```

The first form runs the operation. `--resolve` prints the entrypoint the operation would run, or nothing when the operation is a no-op on this machine. A caller uses it when a platform implementation replaces a generic step (see [Callers](#callers)).

| Situation | Run | `--resolve` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The platform registers no package (`x86` and `aarch64` today) | no-op, exit 0 | prints nothing, exit 0 |
| The entrypoint exists and passes the trust rules | execs it; its exit status is the result | prints its path |
| A required operation has no entrypoint, and the package is not installed | exit 3 (an entrypoint's own status could also be 3; with `--resolve` it is only this): `Error: <operation> on <platform> needs <package>, which provides <path>; it is not installed` | same error |
| A required operation has no entrypoint, but the package is installed (its pacman record says so) | exit 1: `Error: <operation> on <platform> needs <path>, which <package> <version> does not provide; update <package>` | same error |
| An optional operation has no entrypoint (every setup and app-install operation is optional, so none of them ever fails for a missing package) | no-op, exit 0 | prints nothing, exit 0 |
| A user operation (`setup-user`, `post-install`, `pre-remove`) is run as root on a platform that registers it (Apple Silicon), its entrypoint installed or not | exit 1: `Error: <operation> runs as the user, never as root` | same error |
| The entrypoint fails the trust rules | exit 1: `Error: refusing <path>: ...` (optional operations too) | same error |
| `omarchy-hw-platform` can't settle the platform | exit 1 | exit 1 |
| No operation, or one outside the fixed set | exit 2 with usage | exit 2 |

## Operations

The set is fixed in the dispatcher; adding one is a change to Omarchy. Every operation runs as root except `setup-user`, `post-install` and `pre-remove`, which run as the user. The `provision-*` operations take no arguments and work on fixed paths: `/var/lib/omarchy/provisioning` holds the staged install key (`luks-key`) and the re-key journal (`luks-rekey.state`). `luks-slots` takes the slot numbers it records. Factory reset names the factory root it is about to activate, since that is not `/` yet, and hands `reset-commit` the throwaway key on standard input, never in arguments.

| Operation | Called | Contract | Apple | Caller |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `provision-prepare` | Owner provisioning, at the start of every setup attempt, before the owner is asked anything | Succeeds when the platform can finish setup on this machine. On failure its stderr is shown on tty1 and logged, and the attempt fails into the usual retry screen. It must leave nothing a retry can't repeat. | required | `omarchy-provision-owner` |
| `provision-commit` | Owner provisioning, during the LUKS re-key: after the owner's key is added, before any other slot is retired | Removes every boot-time copy of the staged key and its unlock configuration from the platform's boot chain, and rebuilds the boot files so the next boot asks for the password. Idempotent. If it fails, it leaves or restores a boot chain that still unlocks unattended with the staged key, so the retry boots. | required | `omarchy-provision-owner` |
| `provision-verify` | Owner provisioning, whenever it asks whether the staged unlock remains: before the re-key, during it, and before setup drops `pending` | Read-only. Exits 0 only when the boot chain holds no staged key or unlock configuration. Any other status counts as "remains", so setup never finishes. | required | `omarchy-provision-owner` |
| `reset-prepare <factory-root> [<luks-device>]` | Factory reset, once the factory root is cloned and scrubbed, before switching to it. The device is there only when the root is encrypted. | Stages the platform's boot state for the factory root: the unlock's command line, the rebuilt boot files, and encryption state reopened for the next owner. It keeps what `reset-rollback` restores, and writes no key. | required | `omarchy-system-factory-reset` |
| `reset-verify <factory-root>` | Factory reset, right after `reset-prepare` and before the throwaway slot is added and the switch committed | Read-only. Proves the rebuilt boot files boot the factory root on this boot chain. A failure rolls the reset back. | required | `omarchy-system-factory-reset` |
| `reset-commit` (key on standard input) | Factory reset, once the factory root is the active root | Puts the throwaway key where the staged unlock reads it, so the first boot unlocks unattended until owner setup re-keys, and drops what `reset-rollback` would restore. A failure is logged, not fatal: that boot asks for the current disk password once. | required | `omarchy-system-factory-reset` |
| `reset-rollback` | Factory reset, when anything fails after `reset-prepare` started and before the factory root is active, `reset-prepare`'s own failure included | Restores the previous boot state. Nothing to restore is a success. | required | `omarchy-system-factory-reset` |
| `update-verify` | Update, after the last package step: the transaction, migrations, orphan removal and AUR packages | Read-only. Verifies the boot chain boots the updated system, whose new kernel may still wait for its reboot. A failure leaves the update unfinished: it exits non-zero and offers no reboot. | required | `omarchy-update-boot` (`omarchy update`) |
| `update-takeover <path>...` | Update, when an Omarchy package's upgrade stopped only on files no package owns, before they are moved aside for the retry | Read-only. Gets those paths. Exit 0 lets the takeover go ahead; any other status keeps every file where it is, and the update fails as it would have without the retry. A platform whose boot chain or image writes files it can't do without refuses those. | required | `omarchy-update-system-pkgs-when-conflicted` (`omarchy update`) |
| `luks-slots` | Owner provisioning, once the re-key keeps only the owner's slot, before it destroys the staged key; the disk password change, with `--owner` before anything changes on the system disk, then once the owner's new key is confirmed | `luks-slots owner=<slot> [recovery=<slot>]` records the root volume's kept slots wherever the platform's boot checks look for them. Owner setup passes an empty `recovery=`, which records none. Omarchy creates no recovery key; `recovery=` exists only for a slot an earlier Mac setup recorded, which stays when the argument is left out. `luks-slots --owner` changes nothing: it exits 0 printing the recorded owner slot when that slot is in the LUKS header; 4 with `No owner key slot is recorded` on stderr when there is no owner record at all (a Mac set up before its boot package recorded slots); and 1 with the reason on stderr for anything else: a record that isn't a slot number or names a slot the header lacks, an unreadable header, or a boot package too old to know `--owner`. Idempotent. It fails when a slot is not in the LUKS header, and the caller then retries. | required | `omarchy-provision-owner`, `omarchy-drive-password` |
| `setup-boot [image-first-boot]` | Hardware setup's last leaf (`install/hardware/platform-setup.sh`), before `setup-system`, on every install and rerun of `omarchy-apply-hardware`, and on an image's first boot with `image-first-boot` | The platform boot package's own boot setup (on a Mac, the GRUB console settings and the Limine activation). Idempotent. With `image-first-boot` it asks for the boot-file rebuild by creating `/var/lib/omarchy/image/boot-rebuild` where it would build one. A failure fails the leaf, and `setup-system` does not run. | required | `install/hardware/platform-setup.sh` |
| `setup-system [image-first-boot]` | Hardware setup, as its last leaf (`install/hardware/platform-setup.sh`), after `setup-boot`, on every install and every rerun of `omarchy-apply-hardware`. In an image build it is queued with the other leaves and runs on the machine's first boot, with `image-first-boot`. | The platform's machine-wide setup: services, configuration and drivers its runtime package owns. Idempotent. Needs no network with `image-first-boot` (that boot may be offline), and there it asks for a boot-file rebuild by creating `/var/lib/omarchy/image/boot-rebuild` rather than building one, since the deferred setup rebuilds once after its last step. A failure fails the leaf, and on an image's first boot the step stays queued for the next boot. | optional | `install/hardware/platform-setup.sh` |
| `setup-user` | Runs as the user being set up: at the end of user finalization (`install/user/platform-setup.sh`, from `install/user/all.sh`), and in first run once the session is up. Finalization inside an image build skips it; first run on the machine runs it. | The platform's per-user setup. Idempotent. Finalization may have no session (the ISO chroot, owner setup), so work that needs one (a user unit started now, a D-Bus call) is left for the first-run call, and its absence is not a failure. A failure fails finalization or the first-run step, so first run stays pending and runs it again at the next login. | optional | `install/user/platform-setup.sh`, `omarchy-provision-first-run` |
| `post-install <app>` | Runs as the user, from an installer once `<app>` is installed and Omarchy's own setup of it is done: `chromium`, `chrome`, `edge`, `brave`, `brave-origin`, `firefox`, `zen` (`omarchy-install-browser`) and `steam` (`omarchy-install-gaming-steam`) | The platform's adjustments for that app, such as its browser flags or a launcher the app needs on this hardware (which may install a package through `sudo`). Idempotent. A failure fails the install. | optional | `omarchy-install-browser`, `omarchy-install-gaming-steam` |
| `pre-remove <app>` | Runs as the user, from a remover before `<app>`'s packages go: `steam` (`omarchy-remove-gaming-steam`) | Undoes what `post-install <app>` added, packages that depend on the app first. Idempotent; nothing to undo is a success. A failure stops the removal before anything is removed. | optional | `omarchy-remove-gaming-steam` |

Snapshot restore is not an operation: a Limine machine restores through `limine-snapper-restore`, and a platform boot package that checks a restore does so through limine-snapper-sync's own hooks.

## Platform registration

Registration is code in `bin/omarchy-lifecycle-dispatch`, not configuration. No file, environment variable or `PATH` entry decides what runs as root.

| Platform | Implementation directory | Package | Required operations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `aarch64-apple` | `/usr/lib/omarchy/mac-boot` | `omarchy-mac-boot` | all its operations |
| `aarch64-apple`: `setup-system`, `setup-user`, `post-install`, `pre-remove` | `/usr/lib/omarchy/mac` | `omarchy-mac` | none |
| `x86`, `aarch64` | none | none | none: every operation is a no-op, and callers keep their generic path |

The entrypoint for an operation is `<implementation directory>/<operation>`. A registered platform's required operations must be shipped. Its optional operations may be left out, and then they are no-ops.

On a Mac, owner provisioning and factory reset have no other path, so their operations are required: a Mac without `omarchy-mac-boot`'s entrypoints stops before the owner form or before the reset is confirmed, with the dispatcher's error naming the package, where the generic Limine path would leave the boot-partition key behind or rebuild a UKI the Mac does not boot. `luks-slots` is required because the Mac's boot checks prove the disk's key slots. `update-verify` is required because nothing else checks what an update left in a Mac's boot chain. `update-takeover` is required because a Mac's boot chain and image write files no package owns, so a Mac whose boot package can't vouch for a takeover keeps its files and the update stops at the conflict. `setup-boot` is required because the Mac's boot setup has no other path in hardware setup: a Mac whose `omarchy-mac-boot` lacks it stops the hardware leaf, asking for the update, where an optional operation would skip the Limine activation. System and user setup and the app-install hooks belong to the Mac's runtime package, `omarchy-mac`, not its boot package, and are optional: a Mac without `omarchy-mac` gets Omarchy's generic setup and installs.

## Trust rules

- The dispatcher runs as `bash -p`, so a root caller's `BASH_ENV` and exported functions run nothing in it, and it refuses an ordinary Bash launch. As root it uses a fixed `PATH`, runs the detector installed beside it with nothing in its environment but that `PATH` (the detector reads only the live device tree as root), and resolves only the fixed implementation directory.
- An entrypoint runs only if it is a regular executable file. Neither the file nor any directory up to `/` may be a symlink, and all of them must be owned by root and not writable by group or others. An entrypoint that fails these rules is refused, even for an optional operation.
- The entrypoint runs with an empty environment apart from `PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin`. It gets the caller's arguments, standard streams and working directory. Entrypoints use fixed paths, never environment variables. Anything that can also run them directly re-checks the platform itself.
- `setup-user`, `post-install` and `pre-remove` refuse root where the platform registers them, so they never run as anyone but their caller. Where it registers none they stay no-ops for root too, so an installer run with `sudo` still finishes there. Their entrypoints follow the same trust rules, and besides `PATH` they get only these, when the caller has them set: `HOME`, `USER`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_STATE_HOME` (where the user's configuration and setup markers live), `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` and `OMARCHY_PATH`.
- For unprivileged tests, `OMARCHY_LIFECYCLE_ROOT` (absolute) prefixes the implementation directory, and the detector's fixture roots apply. Inside that root, files the caller owns count as root's. Root ignores both.

## Callers

A dispatch point takes one of two shapes:

- **A platform step with no generic counterpart:** `omarchy-lifecycle-dispatch <operation> || fail`. It is a no-op on platforms without a boot package.
- **A platform implementation that replaces a generic step:** `--resolve <operation>`. A path means dispatch the operation, an empty result means run the generic step, and a failure fails closed.

Failing closed holds on every platform: where `omarchy-hw-platform` can't settle the platform (contradicting device-tree evidence, for one), first-boot setup and factory reset stop instead of guessing a boot path, and an update fails its verification without the reboot prompt. There is no check before an update's packages change: on a machine whose platform can't be told, the update installs its packages first, and it only then fails verification. A platform that needs an earlier refusal adds that operation with its first entrypoint.

### Owner provisioning (`bin/omarchy-provision-owner`)

- `platform_ready` runs `provision-prepare` and resolves `luks-slots` at the start of each setup attempt, before the keyboard and account forms. If either fails, the owner sees its error, the log records it, and the attempt ends in the retry or root-shell screen.
- The shared re-key (`install/provisioning/luks-rekey.sh`) asks the caller for two callbacks: `luks_auto_unlock_present` and `luks_auto_unlock_drop`. `unlock_owner` resolves `provision-commit` and `provision-verify` once per process. If both resolve, the platform owns the unlock: drop is `provision-commit`, and present is `provision-verify` failing. If neither resolves, the Limine UKI callbacks run unchanged (x86, Snapdragon, other aarch64). If only one resolves, or resolution fails, the unlock counts as present and can't be dropped, so setup never finishes.
- After a factory reset left Limine entries for another machine identity, `run_provisioning` starts the menu over from the template and runs `limine-update`, on every platform.
- The shared re-key calls the caller's `luks_record_slots` once it has verified that only the owner's slot remains and before it destroys the staged key; `omarchy-provision-owner` runs `luks-slots owner=<slot> recovery=` there, a no-op where nothing records them.
- Everything else stays as it is: the wizard, account and login, the journal, slot retirement, the proof that the staged key opens nothing, and cleanup.

### Factory reset (`bin/omarchy-system-factory-reset`)

- `reset_boot_owner` resolves the four reset operations before the reset is confirmed. If all resolve, the platform owns the factory root's boot chain; if none do, the generic path runs unchanged (x86, Snapdragon, other aarch64: throwaway slot, keyfile in the Limine UKI, `limine-update`, `verify_limine_hashes`). If only some resolve, or resolution fails (a Mac without `omarchy-mac-boot`'s entrypoints), the reset stops before anything changes.
- Where the platform owns it, the order is: authorise with the current passphrase and stage the throwaway in the factory root's `/var/lib/omarchy/provisioning/luks-key`; `reset-prepare`; `reset-verify`; add the throwaway slot; switch the subvolumes; `reset-commit` with the throwaway on standard input. The slot comes after verification, so a failed rebuild adds no credential, and the platform writes its boot-time key only after the switch, so a power loss before it leaves the previous root asking for its password, never unlocked unattended.
- Any failure before the switch runs `reset-rollback` (once `reset-prepare` started), then revokes the slot this attempt added (found by the throwaway key when the add was not confirmed) and deletes the clone: the previous root stays the one that boots, with its boot files and encryption state. Operation output goes to the reset log; a failure shows the operation's last line.
- Everything else stays as it is: the @factory clone, identity and account scrub, provisioning markers and units, LUKS discovery, the passphrase check, the throwaway slot, and the subvolume switch.

### Update (`bin/omarchy-update`)

- `omarchy-update-boot` runs `update-verify` after AUR packages, which the update runs last, so it is the last sudo-capable step; like AUR it follows third-party build code, so it authenticates through the no-update wrapper without a reusable timestamp. When it fails, the update still releases Stay Awake, then says the update is not finished and exits 1 without the reboot prompt.
- It resolves the operation as the user first and runs it with `sudo` only when it resolves to an entrypoint, so an update with nothing to run never asks for root. A failed resolution fails the step with the dispatcher's message, except one: `update-verify` on a machine without its platform's boot package at all (exit 3) warns that the boot files were not verified and lets the update finish. Such a machine predates the package and boots a chain it does not manage; once the package is installed, a failed verification blocks. A package too old to ship `update-verify` blocks, since the fix is one package update away.
- The update path rebuilds no boot file itself: package hooks do, and `update-verify` catches what they missed.
- When an Omarchy package's upgrade stops only on files no package owns, `omarchy-update-system-pkgs-when-conflicted` moves them aside and retries. Before it moves anything it resolves `update-takeover` as the user and, when it resolves, runs `sudo omarchy-lifecycle-dispatch update-takeover <path>...` (inside the update's authorization, which the move needs anyway). A refusal, or a failed resolution (a Mac without its boot package, or with one too old to ship the operation), keeps every file and fails the update as it did before the retry existed. Where nothing resolves, the takeover goes ahead with no extra step.

### Hardware setup (`install/hardware/platform-setup.sh`)

- The last leaf of `install/hardware/all.sh` runs `setup-boot`, then `setup-system`, so both build on every generic leaf. As a `run_logged` leaf it is queued in an image build like any other, and `omarchy-provision-hardware` runs it on the first boot with `OMARCHY_IMAGE_DEFERRED_HARDWARE=1`, which the leaf passes on as `image-first-boot` to both. The environment variable itself never reaches the entrypoints.

### User setup (`install/user/platform-setup.sh`, `bin/omarchy-provision-first-run`)

- The last leaf of `install/user/all.sh` runs `setup-user` at the end of finalization. While `/var/lib/omarchy/image/target` exists the root is still being built, where a normal user's detector would read the build host, so the leaf says so and skips it.
- First run runs `setup-user` again as its own step, after the user units are enabled, now that the session is up. Its failure, like finalization's, leaves first run pending for the next login.

### App installs (`bin/omarchy-install-browser`, `bin/omarchy-install-gaming-steam`, `bin/omarchy-remove-gaming-steam`)

- A browser install runs `post-install <browser>` once the browser's package, policy directory, flags file and theme are in place, and before it says the browser is installed. Steam's install runs `post-install steam` after the 32-bit drivers and the package, and before the first launch, and Steam's removal runs `pre-remove steam` before its packages go, so a package the hook added that depends on Steam doesn't stop the removal.
- On a platform that registers none, each call is a no-op and the installer runs as before.

### Disk password change (`bin/omarchy-drive-password`)

- After the system disk's key changed and the new key is confirmed, `record_owner_slot` resolves `luks-slots` as the user and, when it resolves, runs `sudo omarchy-lifecycle-dispatch luks-slots owner=<slot>`, so no other platform sees an extra `sudo`. Until that succeeds the journal stays, and the next run finishes the change and records the slot. The new key can land in another slot (cryptsetup 2.8's `luksChangeKey` moves a LUKS1 key to the first free slot, and keeps a LUKS2 one in place), and the boot check would then find a slot the platform did not record.
- Before anything changes, where `luks-slots` resolves, `owner_slot_matches` runs `sudo omarchy-lifecycle-dispatch luks-slots --owner` and refuses a current password whose slot is not the owner's, so another key on the system disk, such as a recovery key an earlier Mac setup added, stays as it is and can't take the owner's place. Exit 4 (no owner slot recorded) is taken as a machine nobody recorded: the change goes on only when the current password opens the disk's one key slot, checked again before the key changes, and records the new slot as the owner's once it is confirmed; with other keys on the disk it stops, naming the slots and saying how to record them (`luks-slots owner=<slot> recovery=<slot>`) or remove the extra key. Any other failure stops the change with the boot package's reason.

## Key slots

Omarchy has no disk recovery key: the disk, the login user and root share one password, as on every install. The re-key keeps the owner's slot alone.

- **The owner's password:** the owner's slot is the re-key's own step, so a retry may still choose a new password while the staged key opens the disk, even after the boot step: the re-key then retires the old password's slot and records the final slot with `luks-slots`.
- **Temporary key:** setup finishes only after the re-key proved the staged key opens nothing, the boot package's `provision-verify` found no boot-time copy, and `luks-slots` recorded the kept slot.

## Platform files

A platform's runtime package describes its hardware in files under the platform root, `/usr/share/omarchy-platform/`, without an operation and without a branch in Omarchy's code: display hints, camera cutouts, audio nodes, keyrings and key names (see [file-layout.md](file-layout.md#platform-root)). Only the one installed platform package owns the root, and Omarchy ships nothing in it. The root is fixed: no environment variable moves it, and a development checkout in `OMARCHY_PATH` doesn't replace it. A missing root or file means no platform additions. It changes no binds, settings or gestures: Omarchy behaves the same on every machine.

- **Key names: `key-names`**, one `<keysym> <name>` per line, which the keybindings menu shows in place of the keysym (a MacBook's `XF86MonBrightnessUp` is its F2 key). Its tests run copies of the menu that read a fixture root (`platform_root_copy` in `base-test.sh`).

## Apple Silicon

`omarchy-mac-boot`, from omacom/omarchy-mac-pkgs, implements the Apple boot operations as small entrypoints around its boot modules and installs them in `/usr/lib/omarchy/mac-boot`. `omarchy-mac`, from the same repository, implements `setup-system`, `setup-user`, `post-install` and `pre-remove` in `/usr/lib/omarchy/mac`. Their documentation describes each one. Nothing Apple-specific lives in Omarchy beyond the registration above.

## Snapdragon

Snapdragon laptops are `aarch64` here: they boot Limine with unified kernel images, like x86, every operation is a no-op there, and provisioning uses the Limine UKI callbacks, so Dragon behaves exactly as before.

## Tests

- `test/shell.d/lifecycle-dispatch-test.sh` covers the dispatcher on every platform fixture:
  - the setup and app-install operations: no-ops off Apple, `omarchy-mac`'s directory on Apple (never `omarchy-mac-boot`'s), no-ops without `omarchy-mac`, the user operations refused as root and given only their allowlisted environment
  - no-ops on x86 and plain aarch64, even with Mac entrypoints on disk
  - Apple with and without the boot package, and with one too old to ship an operation
  - arguments, exit status and the cleared environment
  - untrusted entrypoints
  - usage errors, and an undetermined platform
  - an ordinary Bash launch, and root ignoring fixture roots, `BASH_ENV` and exported functions
- `test/shell.d/luks-rekey-journal-test.sh` runs owner provisioning through the real dispatcher:
  - the crash-and-resume matrix on x86 (Limine UKI path unchanged, no Mac entrypoint runs) and on Apple with a fake boot package (the owner's slot recorded), on a slot-table fake and on file-backed LUKS2 and LUKS1 volumes
  - setup stopping before the owner form when the boot package is not ready, missing, or too old to ship the provisioning entrypoints
  - the stale-entry refresh rebuilding through `limine-update`, behind the boot package's `provision-verify` on Apple
  - the worker failing closed without the provisioning entrypoints, or when a boot package implements only one of `provision-commit` and `provision-verify`
- `test/shell.d/platform-setup-test.sh` runs the two setup leaves (the system one running `setup-boot`, then `setup-system`, and stopping when either fails or the boot package lacks `setup-boot`) and first run through the real dispatcher: each is the last of its setup, a no-op on x86, `image-first-boot` only on an image's first boot, the user leaf waiting for first run in an image build, and a failing entrypoint failing the leaf and keeping first run pending. `test/shell.d/image-deferred-hardware-test.sh` checks that an image build queues every hardware leaf, the system one included.
- `test/shell.d/first-run-test.sh` checks that a failed finalization keeps first run pending.
- `test/shell.d/platform-app-hooks-test.sh` runs every browser install and Steam's install and removal through the real dispatcher: on Apple each calls its hook once, after the package and flags (before removal for `pre-remove`), and fails with it; on x86 none runs, even with Mac entrypoints on disk.
- `test/shell.d/update-file-conflict-test.sh` checks the takeover: on x86 it goes ahead asking no one; on Apple it goes ahead only when the boot package's `update-takeover` vouches for exactly the files that move, and a refusal, a missing boot package or one too old keep every file.
- `test/shell.d/factory-reset-dispatch-test.sh` runs the reset through the real dispatcher: on x86 with Mac entrypoints on disk that must not run (generic path unchanged), and on Apple into a fake boot package, covering a finished reset, a failed verification and a failed switch that roll back, an unconfirmed throwaway slot found by its key and revoked, a failed commit after the switch, and a missing or partial package.
- `test/shell.d/update-boot-verify-test.sh` runs `omarchy update` through the real `omarchy-update-boot` and dispatcher inside the sudo boundary fixture: no-ops and no root on x86 and plain aarch64; on Apple, verify after AUR through the no-update wrapper, a failed verification that offers no reboot, and a Mac without the package or with one too old.
- `test/shell.d/drive-password-test.sh` checks that an Apple password change records the owner's new slot through `luks-slots`, including after an interruption, and that x86 never calls it; that `--owner` failing (1, or a slot that isn't a number) stops the change with the reason; and that with no owner slot recorded (4) a one-key disk changes and records its slot, also after an interruption, while a disk with another key, or one that gains a key during the prompts, is refused unchanged.
