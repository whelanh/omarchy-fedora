# Image builds and the hardware setup they defer to the machine's first boot.
# Sourced by omarchy-apply-hardware and omarchy-provision-hardware; no shebang.
#
# An image is built away from the machine it will run on, so hardware setup
# during the build would describe the builder, not the target. The builder
# declares the build in a root-owned manifest before it runs
# omarchy-apply-system in the image root:
#
#   /var/lib/omarchy/image/target
#     format=1
#     platform=x86|aarch64|aarch64-apple
#
# While it exists, omarchy-apply-hardware queues each hardware leaf in
# /var/lib/omarchy/image/deferred-steps instead of running it, and arms
# omarchy-provision-hardware.service. On the machine's first boot that service,
# or the platform's own first boot, retires the manifest (to target.booted) and
# runs the queue on the real hardware. Unknown manifest keys are ignored so the
# format can grow.
#
# An image carries no pacman master key of its own, or every machine flashed
# from it would share one: where install finalization would make the keyring
# (install/post-install/pacman.sh), a build requests it in
# /var/lib/omarchy/image/pacman-keyring instead, and the first boot makes it
# before any deferred step runs.
#
# The manifest is also the only source of the image's platform: until that boot,
# omarchy-hw-platform reports its platform instead of the build host's, so the
# initramfs, services and packages the build sets up are the target's. It reads
# the manifest by the same rules as omarchy_image_read_manifest below.
#
# Root always uses the fixed paths. Only a non-root test may move them under
# OMARCHY_IMAGE_ROOT, so no environment variable can make a live system defer,
# skip or replay its hardware setup.
