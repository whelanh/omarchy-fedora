# When fingerprint or FIDO2 auth was set up while /etc/pam.d/polkit-1 did not yet
# exist -- the normal case on Arch, where the polkit package ships its stack in
# /usr/lib/pam.d/polkit-1 -- the setup commands hand-rolled an /etc/pam.d/polkit-1
# that lists pam_unix directly instead of `include system-auth`. That override
# dropped pam_faillock, so polkit prompts had no brute-force lockout and their
# failures never counted toward the shared tally. The setup commands now defer to
# system-auth; this repairs the files the old ones already wrote.
#
# Only the exact stack those commands produced is touched. Every non-blank,
# non-comment line must be one of the known hardware-auth auth lines (the
# clamshell gate, pam_fprintd, or the FIDO2 pam_u2f line) or a bare
# `X required pam_unix.so`; all four bare pam_unix lines must be present; and
# system-auth must not already be included. This matches the fingerprint, FIDO2,
# combined, and post-removal (markerless, both remove commands strip only their
# own marker lines) layouts, and refuses any administrator-authored stack that
# carries other directives. The repair replaces only the bare pam_unix lines, so
# comments and the hardware-auth lines are preserved verbatim.
